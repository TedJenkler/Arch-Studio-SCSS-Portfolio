## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site.
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email`, or `Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty".
  - The `Email` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address".
- **Bonus**: View actual locations on the contact page map. The addresses we have on the design are fictional, so you'll need to add real addresses for this bonus task.

## My process

### Built with

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - A frontend build tool for fast development with a modern workflow.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation) - For advanced styling and creating flexible, maintainable stylesheets.
- [Formik](https://formik.org/) - For managing form state and validation with ease.
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/api/motion/) - For creating smooth and interactive animations.
- [React Router v6](https://reactrouter.com/) - For handling routing in a React application.
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - For interactive maps.
- [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) - For schema validation and form validation logic.

### What I learned

During this project, I gained more experience in the following areas:

- **SCSS:** Enhanced understanding of SCSS features like mixins, maps, variables, and responsive design.
- **CSS Overlays:** Learned how to use CSS to create overlays for darkening content.
- **Formik:** Improved skills in managing form state and validation using Formik.
- **Framer Motion:** Gained experience in creating smooth and interactive animations with Framer Motion.

### Continued Development

- Plan to make the site fully responsive on all devices.
- Add more animations and improve existing ones.
